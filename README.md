# My Lightstrip

### Background

Originally, I started this project to learn how to create an Alexa skill. I also used this opportunity to create an iOS companion app.

Taking inspiration from the Philips Hue product line, the Alexa skill and app enables the user to change the colour and brightness of a WS2812 light strip.



### About

I created this custom Alexa skill to learn the different components that make up an Alexa skill.
